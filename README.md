# NAME #

BEX - Browser Editor for XML

# SYNOPSIS #

	$('textarea.hasXML').bexdocument();

The `textarea` is replaced with a javascript-based in-browser XML editor, and the contents are parsed as XML. 

# DESCRIPTION #

BEX intends to be a fully-functional client-side XML editor that is:

- Simple
- Extensible
- Accessible
- Fast
- Reliable

The goal (which has not yet been reached), is that a BEX user can make any change to an XML document they require, without making any changes that the user did not intend.

# DEVELOPMENT #

This software is pre-alpha and in deveopment. Key initial goals are:

- Round-tripping for 100% of real documents 
- A DOM which lets you do anything you should be able to do but nothing you shouldn't
- An interface that is fully keyboard and touch accessible
